[[vertx:run]]
=== *vertx:run*

This goal allows to run the Vert.x application as part of the Maven build.
The application is always run as a forked process.

The goal has the following exclusive configuration apart from the applicable **<<common:run-configurations,Common Run Configuration>>**

[cols="1,5,2,3"]
|===
| Element | Description | Property| Default

|runArgs
|The list of arguments that can be passed as part of `run` command.  You can also pass the required run arguments using the system
property. e.g. `-Dvertx.runArgs="--worker --instances=2"`. The system property takes precedence over the plugin configurations
|vertx.runArgs
|&nbsp;

| options
| The configuration file to use to configure Vert.x.
This property is passed as the `-options` option to vertx run.
| vertx.options
| src/main/config/options.json or src/main/config/options.yml or src/main/config/options.yaml

| config
| The configuration file to use to configure the application.
This property is passed as the `-config` option to vertx run.
| vertx.config
| src/main/config/application.json or src/main/config/application.yml or src/main/config/application.yaml

| jvmArgs
| The Java Options that will be used when starting the application, these are the values that are
typically passed to vert.x applications using --java-opts.
| vertx.jvmArguments
| _no arguments_

| redeploy
| Whether the redeployment is enabled
| &nbsp;
| false

| redeployScanPeriod
| The file system check period (in milliseconds)
| vertx.redeploy.scan.period
| 1000

| redeployGracePeriod
| The amount of time (in milliseconds) to wait between 2 re-deployments
| vertx.redeploy.grace.period
| 1000

|===

When the redeployment is enabled, it replays the plugin configured between the _generate-source_ and
_process-classes_ phases.

So to start a Vert.x application just launch:

[source]
----
mvn vertx:run
----

If the sources are not compiled, the plugin executes `mvn compile` for you.

IMPORTANT: `vertx:run` starts the application in a forked JVM.

[[vertx:debug]]
=== *vertx:debug*
This goal allows to debug the Vert.x application.The application is started in a JVM with the debugging enabled.In
your IDE, you need to create a **remote** debug configuration to plug the debugger.

The goal does not have any exclusive configuration, **<<common:run-configurations,Common Run Configuration>>**
defines all the applicable configurations for the goal.

| Element | Description | Property| Default

| options
| The configuration file to use to configure Vert.x.
This property is passed as the `-options` option to vertx run.
| vertx.options
| src/main/config/options.json or src/main/config/options.yml or src/main/config/options.yaml

| config

This property is passed as the `-config` option to vertx run.
| vertx.config
| src/main/config/application.json or src/main/config/application.yml or src/main/config/application.yaml

| jvmArgs

typically passed to vert.x applications using --java-opts.
| vertx.jvmArguments
| _no arguments_

| debugPort
| The debugger port
| debug.port
| 5005

| debugSuspend
| Whether the application must wait until a debugger is attached to start
| debug.suspend
| false
|===

IMPORTANT: the redeploy mode and debug cannot be used together.
When `vertx:debug` is launched, the redeployment mode is disabled.
