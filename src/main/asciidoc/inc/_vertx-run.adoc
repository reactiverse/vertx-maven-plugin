[[vertx:run]]
= *vertx:run*

This goal allows to run the Vert.x application as part of the Maven build, in a separate process.

By default, it monitors the `src/main` directory and, if the code changes, rebuilds the project and restarts the application.
The plugin re-executes the mojos that ran between the _generate-source_ and the _process-classes_ phases.

So, to start a Vert.x application, just launch:

[source]
----
mvn vertx:run
----

If the sources aren't compiled, the plugin executes `mvn compile` for you.

[[run-configuration]]
== Configuration

The `run` goal has the following parameters apart from the ones mentioned in **<<common:configurations,Common Configuration>>**:

.Run Configuration
[cols="1,5,2,3"]
|===
| Element | Description | Property | Default

| `redeploy`
| Whether redeployment is enabled.
| `vertx.redeploy.enabled`
| `true`

| `redeployRootDirectory`
| The root directory to scan for changes.
| &nbsp;
| `${project.basedir}/src/main`

| `redeployIncludes`
| A list of https://ant.apache.org/manual/dirtasks.html#patterns[Ant-like] patterns of files/directories to include in change monitoring.
The patterns must be expressed relatively to the `rootDirectory`.
| &nbsp;
| &nbsp;

| `redeployExcludes`
| A list of https://ant.apache.org/manual/dirtasks.html#patterns[Ant-like] patterns of files/directories to exclude from change monitoring.
The patterns must be expressed relatively to the `rootDirectory`.
| &nbsp;
| &nbsp;

| `redeployScanPeriod`
| How often, in milliseconds, should the source files be scanned for file changes.
| `vertx.redeploy.scan.period`
| `250`

| `redeployGracePeriod`
| How long, in milliseconds, the plugin should wait between two redeployments.
| `vertx.redeploy.grace.period`
| `1000`

| `jvmArgs`
| The JVM arguments that will be used when starting the Vert.x application.
| `vertx.jvmArguments`
| &nbsp;

| `runArgs`
| The list of arguments that can be passed to the main class, if it is a Vert.x launcher.
You can also pass the required run arguments using the system property. e.g. `-Dvertx.runArgs="--worker --instances=2"`.
The system property takes precedence over the plugin configurations
| `vertx.runArgs`
| &nbsp;

| `options`
| The Vert.x configuration file path that will be passed to the main class, if it is a Vert.x launcher, as `-options`.
If a YAML file is configured then it will be converted to JSON by the plugin.
The converted file will be saved in `${project.outputDir}/conf` directory.
| `vertx.options`
| `src/main/options.json` or `src/main/options.yaml` or `src/main/options.yml`

| `config`
| The verticle configuration file path that will be passed to the main class, if it is a Vert.x launcher, as `-conf`.
If a YAML file is configured then it will be converted to JSON by the plugin.
The converted file will be saved in `${project.outputDir}/conf` directory.
| `vertx.config`
| `src/main/config/application.json` or `src/main/config/application.yml` or `src/main/config/application.yaml`

| `vertxWebEnvironment`
| The link:https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_development_mode[environment] for Vert.x Web apps.
| `vertxweb.environment`
| Defaults to either the `VERTXWEB_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable value or, if absent, to `dev`.

| `workDirectory`
| The working directory for the Vert.x application.
| `vertx.directory`
| `${project.basedir}`

| `disableBlockedThreadChecker`
| Whether the Vert.x application should be started with its blocked thread checker disabled.
| `vertx.disable.blocked.thread.checker`
| `true`

| `debug`
| Whether the JVM running the Vert.x application should start a remote debug server.
| `vertx.debug`
| `true`

| `debugSuspend`
| Whether the application must wait until a debugger is attached before starting.
| `vertx.debug.suspend`
| `false`

| `debugPort`
| The remote debug server port.
| `vertx.debug.port`
| `5005`
