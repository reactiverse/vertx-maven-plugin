| Element | Description | Property | Default

| serviceProviderCombination
| Whether SPI files (`META-INF/services`) need to be combined. Accepted valued as `combine` and `none`.
| &nbsp;
| combine

| classifier
| The classifier to add to the artifact generated. If given, the artifact will be attached with that classifier
and the main artifact will be deployed as the main artifact. If this is not given (default), it will replace
the main artifact and only the Vert.x (fat) jar artifact will be deployed (in the Maven sense). Attaching the
artifact allows to deploy it alongside to the original one. Attachment is controlled using the `attach`
parameter.

| &nbsp;

| attach
| Whether the created archive needs to be attached to the project. If attached, the _fat_ jar is
installed and deployed alongside the main artifact (plain jar). Notice that you can't disable attachment if
the classifier is not set (it would mean detaching the main artifact).

| true

| skipScmMetadata
| Whether the SCM metadata should be retrieved from the SVN or Git repository

| true
